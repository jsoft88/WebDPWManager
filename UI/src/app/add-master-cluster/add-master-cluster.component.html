    <h3>As explained in docs, there are three different layered masters: Time Master, Watcher Master and Child Watcher Master.
    To launch and monitor a process all three master types are required, so we could view them as a cluster of masters.
    This cluster of masters will run on top of an actor system, which could be seen as a segmentation among clusters.</h3>
